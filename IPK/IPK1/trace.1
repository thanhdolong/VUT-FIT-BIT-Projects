.SH SYNOPSIS
.B trace
[\fB\-f\fR \fIFIRST_TTL\fR]
[\fB\-m\fR \fIMAX_TTL\fR]
.IR host
.SH DESCRIPTION
Traceroute tracks the route packets taken from an IP network on their way to a given host.
This program use  time to live (TTL) and ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED response for finding the path to the host.
There is used fixed port "33434".

The only mandatory parameter is destination host name or IP number. It supports IPv4 and also IPv6. The default time to live is 1 and maximal hops is 30.

.B Other possible annotations instead of time which can be printed:

!H Host unreachable.
.br
!N Network unreachable.
.br
!P Protocol unreachable.
.br
!X Communication administratively	prohibited.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.IP "-n FIRST_TTL"
Set the initial time-to-live value used in outgoing probe packets.
The default is 1 hop.
.IP "-m MAX_TTL"
Set the max time-to-live (max number of hops) used in outgoing probe packets.
